				 In lieu of the notes above, we attempted to observe relationship between income and migration in metropolitan areas in the United States using migration and income data between 2013 and 2017 from the U.S. Census. Not seeing as large of an association as we expected, we decided to modify our objectives. 
				 In addition to visualizing migration data, we wanted to explore reasons why specific metropolitan areas either diverged from or followed our hypothesis, highlighting interesting historical and economic events around outliers. <br> <br> Scroll down to explore!

The Villages (FL), Myrtle Beach (SC), and Greeley (CO) are <b> popular retirement destinations</b>, hence their <b> low RPI and high net migration ratios.</b> All three have a relatively <b> low cost of living,</b> are <b> suburban,</b> and are somewhat <b>close to a high-density metropolitan area.</b> For example, Greeley is in close proximity to Denver.

					<p>
As seen in the scatterplot above, Midland, Texas has the <b> highest RPI but a negative net migration. </b> 
Midland is part of the <b> Permian Basin,</b> a large oil-and-gas producing region in West Texas. As such, migration is heavily dependent on how the energy industry is doing. In light of Trumps’ presidency, the current oil boom has resulted in record-breaking levels of employment and population counts in Midland. The data we have captures the <b> 2015–16 energy slump </b>, in which the Permian Basin <b>rig count tumbled from 548 to a low of 137, </b> which explains the negative migration.

Puerto Rico’s metropolitan areas have the <b> largest population decline </b> of any metropolitan area in the United States.

<b> INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK: </b> 
Our project aims to visually depict migration between metropolitan areas in the United States in light of its relationship with real income, primarily through a guided exploration of economic events and stories behind outlier areas. Previously, the New York Times Upshot released two visualizations: one that mapped migration by state, and one that showed regional migration across the U.S. over time using stream graphs. However, besides presenting interactive visualizations, the articles did not look at any correlations behind migration patterns but simply stated the economic and historical context of each state. While reading preliminary research surrounding migration, we found literature that discussed how individuals within a country converged around advancing and economically prosperous areas. Therefore, we hypothesized that there would be a strong positive link between migration to an area and the area’s real personal income. However, we did not find the strong correlation that we had hoped to find. </div> <br> <br>

<div> 
<b> METHODOLOGY: </b>
We used publicly available U.S. Census data that described the magnitude of individual migration between metropolitan areas from 2013 to 2017. In addition, we also used 2017 real personal income and population data for each metropolitan area. To explore relationships between real personal income and migration, …… (sentence about the exploratory visualizations RICHARD) We settled on using the ratio of individuals moving in or out to the population of the metropolitan area. This transformation allowed us to assess the linear relationship between real personal income and migration while normalizing for the population of each metropolitan area, as sizes for each area heavily varied. For example, the NJ-NY metropolitan area includes New Jersey and all five NYC boroughs, while tiny blocks of Colorado were their own areas. Considering the ratio of new migrants helped us identify the most interesting outliers: Midland, Texas; a group of high migration ratio, low-income retirement locations; lastly, Puerto Rico. </div> <br> <br>

<div>
<b> DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION: </b>
We had three main goals: to be able to effectively show our chosen outliers, to guide the reader through the migration narratives in these areas, and to depict the magnitude of individuals coming in and out of each metropolitan area. We constructed two interactive visualizations: a scatterplot with tooltips constructed in D3, with outlier groups circled in red. Our second interactive used D3 Topojson to show geospatial data. Upon mousing over a metropolitan area, the area itself is colored based on net population change. One can also view the top contributors to the area’s net population change, encoded as different colored and sized lines. If the line between two areas are red, individuals are leaving the area being moused over. If green, individuals are traveling to the area being moused over. The thickness of the line is proportional to the magnitude of individuals leaving or entering. We placed these two visualizations on a webpage and constructed our narrative around our visualizations using Scrollama, where we strung specific text blocks and visualizations together. </div> <br> <br>

<div>
<b> DISCUSSION: </b>
Our final visualization employs a narrative structure aligning with the martini glass, guiding the individual through our unsuccessful data exploration, then each one of our outliers, and finally allowing the individual to explore migration between all metropolitan areas for themselves. It would have been interesting to create a link between the scatterplot and the map, especially because the two look at different statistics: the scatterplot at migration ratio and the map at counts. It would have also allowed for a smoother connection between our discussion of our exploratory data analysis to our final narrative, as many readers scrolled up to view the scatterplot multiple times. However, we found it difficult to fit text, the scatterplot, and a map on the screen together. The most impactful part of our visualization was how the construction of the narrative piqued each readers’ curiosity behind other factors of migration and migration statistics unexplored by us. At the end of the narrative, many readers moused over metropolitan areas of where they came from, looking at both magnitude and geographic location of migrant populations. In fact, we received a lot of feedback surrounding other interesting areas to explore from talking to our readers. One individual mentioned how those in the cold metropolitan areas of Minnesota often had family vacation homes in Arizona, and sure enough, we were able to see this in the interactive. </div> <br> <br> 
<div>
<b> FUTURE WORK: </b>
We’d love to look into employment rate and migration, as we had observed that Midland, Texas’s migration pattern was heavily influenced by the state of the oil industry. We would love to focus more on correlation rather than narrative, looking at data over time and utilizing brushing and linking between plots and maps. In addition, the outliers we found focused on employment and retirement, goals for age-specific groups, another interesting dimension for potential patterns. </div> <br> <br>
